I'm a Colombian Biomedical Engineer doing my Masters' Degree at Universidad de Los Andes, 
Colombia. I'm 23 years old (soon to be 24), passionate about music, history and 
astronomy. During my undergraduate I grew passion towards programming and since then I've
been working on Computer Vision under the supervission of my advisor [Pablo Arbeláez](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co/).
I love jogging, spending time looking at the sky and good music; specially if I can 
reproduce it when playing my guitar or bass. Whenever I have the means to I also build 
scale models of planes of the WWII era.
